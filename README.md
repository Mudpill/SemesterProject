# Semester Project

This is the CS 417 Semester Project. It takes input from a file containing CPU core temperature data
and generates a piecewise linear interpolation, a global linear least squares approximation, and a cubic
spline interpolation for each core which is output to a text file. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Java JDK 18.0.2 - [Download & Install Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html). Check if your system has Java installed by entering `java -version` in your command line. If Java is correctly installed, you should see an output that displays the version of your installed Java.

- Gradle - [Download & Install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/). Check if your system has Gradle installed by entering `gradle -v` in your command line. If Gradle is correctly installed, you should see an output that displays the version of your installed Gradle.
